### Problem Discription
-------
[Flappy Bird](https://flappybird.io "Try Flappy Bird") used to be a prevailing mobile game through the past few years. In this game, players will be required to navigate their bird to pass columns of green pipes without hitting them. Players will get awarded every time the bird surpasses a column of pipe. But in fact, frequent death also tortures players after their impulsive tap spoils everything.
Genetic algorithm is a search-based optimization technique inspired by the process of natural selection and genetics. It uses the same combination of selection, crossover and mutation to evolve initial random population. In this case, we will assembly massive bird generations to explore the path towards the end.
